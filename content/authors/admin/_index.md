I am a PhD candidate in the Institute of Political Science at Leiden University. My research focuses on political parties in Latin America; party performance evaluations; party-voter linkages (mobilization strategies); and the mechanisms that foster the change of ethnic identities. My PhD dissertation looks into the case of the Ecuadorian ethnic party Pachakutik. I research the party's performance, the party's mobilization strategies and how the party segments them (following a spatial perspective), and the party’s role at advancing recognition policies for the indigenous population that have fostered the groups’ division. My work is entirely bilingual: I research, write, and teach in both english and spanish. 

Before joining Leiden University, I served at the Ecuadorian Mission to the Organization of American States (OAS) in Washington D.C. as Second Secretary Alternate Representative of Ecuador. I joined the mission in July 2012. My work there concentrated on the negotiation of Inter-American Human rights conventions.
