I am a PhD candidate in the Institute of Political Science at Leiden University. My doctoral defence is scheduled for July 1, 2021.My research focuses on political parties’ survival, parties’ mobilizations strategies, and the mechanisms that foster changes of ethnic identities. My dissertation, “Surviving against all odds: Pachakutik’s electoral support, mobilisation strategies, and goal achievement between 1996 and 2019” proposes a theory of party survival that focuses on parties with low levels of electoral support and scarce resources. To illustrate my argument, I use the case of Pachakutik, an indigenous party from Ecuador. I completed over 11 months of fieldwork in Ecuador, where I conducted elite interviews and archival work. My work is entirely bilingual: I research, write, and teach in english and spanish. 

Before joining Leiden University, I served at the Ecuadorian Mission to the Organization of American States (OAS) in Washington D.C. as Second Secretary Alternate Representative of Ecuador. I joined the Permanent Mission in July 2012. My work there concentrated on the negotiation of Inter-American Human rights conventions.
