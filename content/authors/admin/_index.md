I am an Assistant Professor of Comparative Politics at Leiden University. Before taking this position, I was an Assistant Professor of Politics and International Relations at Lake Forest College (Illinois, USA). I received my Ph.D. from Leiden University in 2021.  I am a researcher in comparative politics working on political institutions and representation with Latin America as my regional focus. My research and teaching lie at the intersection of representation, identity, ethnicity, and institutions. I deploy a broad set of methodological tools in my work, chiefly qualitative methods (e.g., interviews, participant observation, and discourse analysis), which I combine with various other methodologies, including natural language processing, network analysis, and experimental methods.

I study  women's representation and party organizations. I am particularly interested in the barriers women face when participating in politics and how different stakeholders affect their experiences. I am interested in political parties' survival, their linkages to voters, and the determinants of candidate selection (gender perspective). I also study group identity construction (at the individual and group level) and how these identities affect party formation and persistence, the linkages between parties and voters, and inter-group relations. 

I specialize in teaching qualitative methods at the graduate level, introductory and mid-level seminars on Comparative Politics, Women's Representation, and Latin American Politics, and advanced-level seminars on women's representation and political parties and democracy with a regional focus in Latin America. My work is entirely bilingual: I research, write, and teach in English and Spanish. 

Before starting my career in academia, I served as second secretary alternate representative of Ecuador at the Ecuadorian Mission to the Organization of American States (OAS) in Washington, D.C., until I joined the Permanent Mission in July 2012. My work there concentrated on negotiating inter-American human rights conventions.
