As Second Secretary Alternate Representative of Ecuador to the Organization of American States (OAS) I was assigned as principal negotiator of Inter American Conventions of Human Rights and as one of the Ecuadorian representatives at the Committee of Juridical and Political Affairs [(CAJP)](https://www.oas.org/en/council/CAJP/Default.asp?q=&e=&evento=) of the OAS Permanent Council. 

I was involved in the final negotiations of the [Inter-American Convention against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Related Forms of Intolerance A-68](http://www.oas.org/en/sla/dil/inter_american_treaties_A-70_human_rights_older_persons.asp),  and the  [Inter-American Convention against All Forms of Discrimination and Intolerance A-69](http://www.oas.org/en/sla/dil/inter_american_treaties_A-69_discrimination_intolerance.asp) which were negotiated at the same time. Both Conventions were adopted and open for signature at the 2013 OAS General Assembly in Antigua Guatemala. Ecuador signed both conventions during the General Assembly. 

I was also part of the the negotiations of the [Inter-American Convention on Protecting the Human Rights of Older Persons](http://www.oas.org/en/sla/dil/inter_american_treaties_A-70_human_rights_older_persons.asp) which was adopted in 2015 during the OAS General Assembly in Washington D.C., USA. Ecuador ratified the Convention in March 2019.
